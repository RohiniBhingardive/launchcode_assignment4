                    <h2 class="h2css">Colorado Springs, CO</h2>
                    <p>This is on of the most beautiful places I've visited in my life. Colorado Springs is wonderful place to be in touch with nature. You can visit Maroon Bells, Independence Pass, Garden of the Gods, Pikes Peak, Crystal Lake reservoir. This is one of the must visit destinations I'd suggest to visit while in United States.</p>

                    <h2 class="h2css">Chicago, IL</h2>
                    <p>This is one of the most beautiful man made places to visit. It is exciting to see how thoughtfully the city is rebuilt from scratch after the fire destroyed it years back. Shed Aquarium, Museums etc. are some of the tourist attractions</p>

                    <p>Lake of the Ozarks is nice nearby location to visit for Kansas and Missouri residents. It can be weekend gateway for them. Tourists can do boating, fishing, parasailing, helicopter rides etc. Bridal cave is also nice nearby place to visit.</p>
